Designs_Ergon&ocirc;micos</span></h2><p class="c15 c11"><span class="c2 c17"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">A long time ago in the land of what might be known as the USA, but in our universe known flipped on its head - we were known as the guys who stopped WW3 by having to resort to some not quite normal tactics, perhaps.</span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">I was eating some ritz crackers when the news of WW3 started. The family got together and with no slimmer of thinking, went straight into the bomb shelter. A lot of people thought that this was honestly just a lie and maybe a joke made by a Radio Reporter, but it turned out to be not.</span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everybody thought it was a joke and went back out until </span><span class="c0 c16">they</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;arrived. Instantly everybody went into hiding spots while they fired and ransacked our town. Once it was safe to go out, everybody saw a bunch of buildings destroyed. </span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">The weirdest thing was that only homes had slight damages, and even some unaffected. What was the motive? To solve this, the USA started up a new branch of the government. CFHRD (Center For Human Resources And Defense.) </span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">The CFHRD would donate resources to the people that were troubled, and build prototypes of tools for the US Government and Trusted Individuals that would defend against the armies coming in. Were the tools inhumane? No, not really? Was the thinking and design process inhumane? Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Their first design was a collaboration between them and The Portuguese, &ldquo;</span><span class="c2 c10">Designs_Ergon&ocirc;micos (Ergonomic Design)&rdquo; which was a type of tool split into 2 for ergonomic purposes. Like think of an ergonomic tool as a weapon of sorts. </span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c2 c10"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c10">What the &ldquo;thing&rdquo; if you can even call it that would do is very interesting. It was very streamlined but would send out nails at high paces, like a cannon but for nails. It was very effective against the armies, and some of them retreated.</span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c2 c10"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">The design of these tools quickly showed to the countries invading that they were most likely going to cook up something crazy later, and they tried to send in a few spies. One spy, named </span><span class="c10 c13">U </span><span class="c10">from the land of Poland, and </span><span class="c10 c3">Z</span><span class="c2 c10">, another spy from the land of Japan. Both of them collabed to get as much info as possible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10"><br>A short recorded transcript from the shoe of </span><span class="c10 c13">U</span><span class="c2 c10">&nbsp;was then later sent to Poland Administers, soon released to the public later.</span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c2 c10"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c14">TRANSCRIPT 1: RADIO_RECORDING_U_1</span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c2 c14"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c13">U</span><span class="c2 c0">: So, &nbsp;what are your plans for the next tactical utility?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c7">K</span><span class="c2 c0">: The plan is to make a more advanced version of [REDACTED_INFO.]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c3">Z</span><span class="c2 c0">: Interesting! I can help with that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c7">K</span><span class="c2 c0">: Responding to U, I&rsquo;ll add a few more gadgets and bells, all that stuff.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c13">U</span><span class="c2 c0">: Interesting.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c3">Z</span><span class="c0">: Do you have any prototypes or like </span><span class="c0 c16">blueprints</span><span class="c2 c0">?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c7">K</span><span class="c0">: I&rsquo;ll have to ask or call in </span><span class="c0 c26">Y</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;about that.

What do you need me for?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c7">K</span><span class="c2 c0">: We got some administrative people asking to see the new blueprints of the next prototype.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c26">Y</span><span class="c2 c0">: Coming.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c3">Z</span><span class="c2 c0">: Thanks so much!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c7">K</span><span class="c0">: Any words, </span><span class="c0 c13">U</span><span class="c2 c0">?

We are doing an extensional project that will transform these cannons into absolute destroyers as time goes on, and with the next release of the design and so on, it will only get more crazy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c8">Y</span><span class="c2 c0">: The next design is being sold to the public as a ergonomic self-defense weapon against the armies coming in still, and it will still be used by the US though.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c3">Z</span><span class="c2 c0">: Can we see the blueprints for this design?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c13">U</span><span class="c2 c0">: Im curious if it will still have nails or like faster load time, etcetera.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c8">Y</span><span class="c0">: Of course, let me show you guys. I showed </span><span class="c0 c7">K</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;this a long time ago while it was still in Phase 1 of development but it&rsquo;s almost complete for release. Here&#39;s the blueprint I guess (puts it on table of sorts)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c13">U</span><span class="c2 c0">: Wow. The new design and everything really enchants it!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c13">U</span><span class="c0">: Alright, Me and </span><span class="c0 c3">Z</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;gotta start going now though, Thank you for showing us this. We can help with production as usual!<br></span><span class="c0 c7">K</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c0 c26">Y</span><span class="c2 c0">: See you later!</span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">The CFHRD was going to essentially release ergonomic self-defense weapons that could wipe out entire armies. Surely, this wouldn&rsquo;t get out of hand? Like just having a random cannon in your backyard to wipe out the daily wave of armies from Britain coming in.</span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">It got out of hand, very quickly.</span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><h1 class="c6" id="h.hmczdexrgm0h"><span class="c2 c14">CHAPTER 2: Sund-&thorn;&uacute;sund-Heima</span></h1><p class="c15 c11"><span class="c2 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Your friendly neighborhood friend &ldquo;Bob&rdquo; now had a backyard cannon, and that was just normal for people now. Rather than just trying to stop the war and be pacifist about it, people just accepted it and bought the cannons. </span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">While another invasion was happening a soldier from the opposite team secretly grabbed some cannons and exploded it across the town they were in, barely leaving anything behind. It was like one day it was there, then the next day it wasn&rsquo;t. Messed with my brain whenever I passed by that town cause it was just an empty grassland with a few remnants of buildings.</span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">It really showed how powerful those cannons were. But then the US realized something. They could use these to their advantage. They quickly sent some spies alongside U and Z who may have told the armies a bit too late to the land of Spain.</span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">In collaboration with Portugal, they started mowing down defenses of Spain and they started using the cannons in Madrid and other populated places. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">A transmission between U, Z, and E (a polish soldier) was shared half and half cause the last half of the transmission was insanely distorted due to U and Z being in Madrid which was being destroyed.</span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c14">TRANSMISSION 2: STARE_MIASTO</span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c13">U</span><span class="c0">: </span><span class="c0 c12">E</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;there isn&#39;t much time left here in Spain, and I think they&#39;re going full blast.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c3">Z</span><span class="c2 c0">: They are.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c13">U</span><span class="c2 c0">: Oh?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c12">E</span><span class="c2 c0">: Wait, wait, what&rsquo;s going on.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c13">U</span><span class="c2 c0">: USA Is destroying Spain.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c18">E</span><span class="c2 c0">: I don&#39;t think we have enough time to send armies over there cause you said they&rsquo;re already starting the cannons.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c12">E</span><span class="c2 c0">: Good luck I guess, I don&rsquo;t even know where you guys a-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c13">U</span><span class="c2 c0">: We&rsquo;re in Madrid.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c3">Z</span><span class="c2 c0">: Let the man talk, U.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c13">U</span><span class="c2 c0">: Fine.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">(transmission cuts off due to graininess)</span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Madrid and over 20 towns were destroyed that day. The other countries finally caught up with what the US was most likely doing. They were building a machine that could single handedly destroy all of their armies. They already had the transmissions from </span><span class="c0 c13">U</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c0 c3">Z </span><span class="c2 c0">and they decided to do the race to see who could make the worst and inhumane invention.</span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c3">Z</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;passed on the blueprints to Poland, Germany, and Japan where Poland gave it to Britain as a backup weapon and they quickly started inventing creative ways to make a better </span><span class="c0">cannon</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;than the USA. Like how Poland made it a death switch that would make all of the cannons go off at once in pre-set places.</span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They were getting real creative, and the US started getting worried because they didn&#39;t know who the spies were. </span><span class="c0 c13">U</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c0 c3">Z</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;had climbed up the ranks and were even in Administrative Ranks of the US Army. They had permission to remove powerful people like </span><span class="c0 c12">K</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c0 c26">Y</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;and that&#39;s exactly what they did.</span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Many people who had brains were fired and they took in </span><span class="c0 c13">U</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c0 c3">Z</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;for a search and found their microphones which prompted them to run away to Poland on a boat. Luckily they had gotten the Shoes before anything had happened to it.</span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c2 c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A new day for us felt like time was going backwards. Me and </span><span class="c0 c13">U</span><span class="c0">/</span><span class="c0 c3">Z</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;were employed together in Poland after I went to Poland due to my hometown being destroyed. I was eating my Ritz as usual until they said that the US had been wiped out. Everything was gone and reverted to normal. Mexico and Canada had suffered the changes but got past it.</span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">But then, the world started significantly changing. Nothing felt off, the world was just different without the USA. The war was over at finality. Everybody agreed to keep this topic off really, but it will forever be remembered in history as one of the most confusing wars ever.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">-</span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><h1 class="c6" id="h.2rhdvq2d3hb6"><span class="c22">EPILOGUE: </span><span class="c2 c22 c24">Credit Stuff</span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">2023 EXTENSIONAL PROJECT BLUEPRINT #1</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Based off something I had a dream of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Table Of Contents:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c19 c0"><a class="c20" href="#h.uzsc55l3f6cn">EXTENSIONAL PROJECT BLUEPRINT #1</a></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c19"><a class="c20" href="#h.2heoeltunu0y">CHAPTER 1: Designs_Ergon&ocirc;micos</a></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c19 c0"><a class="c20" href="#h.hmczdexrgm0h">CHAPTER 2: Sund-&thorn;&uacute;sund-Heima</a></span></p><p class="c15 c11"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c16 c21">maplemaplemaplemaple.github.io/techstuff/writingstuff/EXTENSIONALBLUEPRINT.html</span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c15 c11"><span class="c2 c9"></span></p></body></html>

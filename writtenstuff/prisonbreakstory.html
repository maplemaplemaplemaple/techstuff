One morning while going out the police were in the alleyways then proceeded to tackle him from the alley out. Shizuya went entirely black then woke up in a dimly lit room, gray with a table and a light with police viewing outside. He woke up to being interrogated in a room, with false claims of crimes. He did not know anything about this, so he denied but police soon got him to admit to his nonexistent crimes.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He went to court to plead Not Guilty, to no avail as he had admitted to his crimes. Shortly after the court trial, he arrived at his jail in his old hometown of Hiroshima. He evacuated after the bomb and was living in Tokyo after the 1945 attacks. It was entirely rebuilt, with freshly built structures everywhere. He was amazed to see it rebuilt only 12 years after the attacks. He gazed for a short time and before he realized, he was in a Jail Cell.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was booked under Medium Security as a Inmate, with a unique number.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Inmate 48212.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">He then woke up the next morning, freshened up and examined his jail cell. It was a very tall but slim width. He thought of a way to scale out his way, but a problem was how was he gonna fit through the window and the metal bars.</span></p><h1 class="c2" id="h.co22dlhgj4sx"><span class="c3">Chapter 2: Blueprint #1</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c6">I</span><span class="c1">n lieu of things that are cool and fun, he found a way to rot the metal bars. He would water it down and try to hammer it with his soup bowl to break the bars. After a few months of complete isolation and getting the same, Wonton Soup with some milk he had completely rotted away the metal bars on the window.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He now had a plan. The officers came into his cell for talking or check-ins at 2am. He now had the schedule recognized. At 10PM-12 AM selected guards would be on shift patrols, and have a break for an hour. Then at 2AM, they would wake up all the prisoners to see if any escaped. They would then have a 30 minute break and an officer would watch afar from outside afterwards. </span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c2" id="h.ac5nob7eq6t"><span class="c3">Chapter 2.5: A Never-Ending Night</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c9">A</span><span class="c1">t 2AM he heard the guards yell &ldquo;GET UP!&rdquo; which is time for roll call. A swift breeze danced through the air and he got up and went out for roll call with all the other inmates. They all got called up and went on for break. Although Shizuya seemed like an average person, he had abilities nobody knew he was capable of. Once the guards left he had a burst of adrenaline and instantly started scaling the concrete walls, with all his might breaking a fingernail or two. He got to the window no longer equipped with metal bars, with the moonlight emitting into the room and the cold air hitting him, he knew it was go-time.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He shifted his way through and found himself on the roof of the complex. He made a quiet but loud run. Time felt like it was going backwards, and he kept running until he found a settable place. The Mountains of a small village town. The small town was like none other, with its own shops, people, and all that. He found peace. The officers next morning came in for a talk but they found nothing but an empty, smashed bowl and blankets with a pillow under it. The alarms screeched but to no avail cause he was out of the sight of law enforcement. </span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shizuya felt cold in the cave he now resided in. He had a campfire and some makeshift tools, and went out every now and then to hunt some animals. After a few months he did not feel accomplished so he went out to go to a hospital at twilight to acquire new tools. It was a abandoned hospital at that,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">so it was a perfect target. While acquiring a scalpel from a drawer, an alarm went off to alert law enforcement that somebody is in the hospital. He ran as fast as he could but he tripped on something sharp and screeched in pain. </span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He woke up and felt like he was in a metaphorical wonderland, although he realized that he was in a hospital bed with bloodied gauzes and bandages pulled together around his foot. He felt like time was going forward now, and felt warmer than he had been these past few months. The nurse passed over him and greeted him with &ldquo;Pleased that you&rsquo;re awake now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c2" id="h.5o1hhc7n53po"><span class="c3">Chapter 3: Back and Forward</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c9">S</span><span class="c1">he continued on and murmured &ldquo;The police found you passed out at the abandoned hospital in Fukushima, and brought you here. It seemed like you were exploring the hospital which counts as a $550 fine, so you&#39;re fine for now. Haha&rdquo; Shizuya then realized something, the police couldn&rsquo;t identify him. They didn&#39;t know who he was. His appearance had significantly changed and he seemed like an entirely different person then the Shizuya they knew.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But then Shizuya flashed back to reality. His family life, everything. They didn&#39;t know where he was. Reality started to set in for him and he got worried, but he still came up with the plan to go back to the mountains. He had shelter there, and an abundance of resources. After recovering from his injuries in the hospital unknown to him, he walked out and adventures back to the mountains. It was a long walk and his feet sored, but to him this was a new life for him.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He eventually arrived at where he was and how he left it the same, animals roaming the fields with a campfire in the cave that was burned out. He felt enlightened spiritually and mentally. Black is the new black, isn&rsquo;t it?</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He lived near the farm of an old man and one day he went down to the farm. He didn&rsquo;t know the old man owned the farm and decided it was natural and ate tomatoes from it. The old man noticed and got very mad and punched Shizuya. Shizuya was blooming with anger and striked back. The old man was shocked and ordered the police to arrest him. Shizuya was back in court and it was not looking good for him.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After having a trial in Tokyo he got sent all the way to Kyoto which was a 5 hour drive. Shizuya was very tired and oozed off whilst being in the police car.</span></p><h1 class="c2" id="h.90haa1nw9avc"><span class="c3">Chapter 3.5: Nyugen</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c6">S</span><span class="c1">hizuya was shaken awake and was greeted by a Japanese Police Officer&rsquo;s face. He was getting booked into Maximum Security with a cellmate, Nyugen. He came from the Philippines to Japan and did some not too good things. Nyugen and Shizuya got booked into their jail cells, and felt absolutely drained.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nyugen sadly murmured &ldquo;So, what did you do to get here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shizuya responded with &ldquo;I ate some tomatoes and apparently that was too much for them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Nyugen said &ldquo;Dude, I know there&#39;s much more in the frame you&#39;re leaving out, just explain it to me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shizuya replied back once again with &ldquo;I guess I&#39;ll explain it. It goes back to 1957 when I was falsely accused of crimes, and I was booked into medium security at some jail in tokyo. I managed to escape and ran off into the mountains and resided until I got to the tomatoes. Now I&rsquo;m here in Kyoto with nothing to do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nyugen also responded back with &ldquo;Relatable, I guess.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shizuya then murmured out &ldquo;I need to get some sleep. I&rsquo;ll see you tomorrow, whatever your name is.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Nyugen finally replied back &ldquo;The name is Nguyen. Go get a good night&rsquo;s sleep!</span></p><p class="c7 c4"><span class="c13"></span></p><h1 class="c2" id="h.wy3uzwe75clz"><span class="c3">Chapter 4: &ldquo;Here we are again&hellip;&rdquo;</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c6">S</span><span class="c1">hizuya woke back up on his bunk-bed and face planted. The guards told him that he needed to go do laundry, which he accepted. He realized something about the buckets though. They had metal picks around them, which could be used to lockpick the doors. While everyone was distracted, he quickly tended to the metal, scraping it off the bucket and shoving it in his pocket. He continued on with his assignment as usual, until he went back to his cell. He showed Nyugen his new profound item, and they got to work on memorizing the guard&rsquo;s schedule.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They memorized the first 3 things the guard would do, which is get up and start patrolling at about 5am after the night shift. Nyugen and Shizuya would play shifts, for example Shizuya would do day shift while Nyugen did night shift. They got together every week and noted down their findings until they got a complete version of the guard&rsquo;s schedule. With help from other inmates, they also got it complete too. Endless nights while Nyugen would do his shift, Shizuya would stay up looking at the ceiling for hours until he passed out thinking about anything and everything.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When they got the schedule, they waited for the guards to finish their patrol at night then Shizuya picked the lock. They both ran their way out with other inmates following. All of them both said goodbye hoping to meet each other one day and went their separate ways. The alarms once blared again, but to no avail as they were out the sights. </span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shizuya tried going back to his mountain place, but it had been overgrown and blocked off. He had now to find a new home. He walked for endless nights back to Tokyo and found something wild. American flags everywhere, everything american. Japanese girls were sitting next to American Soldiers. Shizuya was absolutely confused and asked some random person and they said they were free.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shizuya was filled with glee, and felt like he was at freedom. He could return back to his normal life as a different person, and be finished with this tragedy of a situation. He managed to rent an apartment in Fukushima, the town of the mountains and got a steady living. He was living the dream!</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c2" id="h.x4eofhjshlfc"><span class="c3">Chapter 5: Falling Down</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c6">S</span><span class="c5">hizuya was growing old, and couldn&rsquo;t deal with much anymore. He had been repeating his normal routine. His days as Shizuya </span><span class="c5">Wo had</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;come to an end and now he was a completely different person. It had been 1979 now, and he slowly started crumbling. Locals knew him as Daisuke Kobayashi, but he was really Shizuya Wo. He was walking home one day after working a long shift at the local Tech Repair company in his city. </span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While walking upon the streets of Fukushima back home, he noticed someone similar. Somebody by the name of Nyugen.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c2" id="h.e28t222ni74m"><span class="c3">Chapter 5.5: NyugenNyugen</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c16">N</span><span class="c1">yugen and Shizuya looked at each other in pure shock and glee as they both glared at each other. They exchanged glances for a good second until they both shouted &ldquo;Nyugen?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Shizuya?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Both were completely in shock. Shizuya questioned where Nyugen had been and he said that he had been in Hiroshima working on cars. He had to go to Fukushima for a business trip </span><span class="c5">for</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;talk towards production on automobile parts exported from India.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shizuya replied back saying that he worked at the local Tech Repair shop here for several things like cars too. Both of them decided to go to the meeting together for one last time. Both of them had grown old and time had started to run out.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So I see you&rsquo;ve brought a friend, Nyugen. What&rsquo;s his name?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Shizuya.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Nice, I heard he was a tech repairman. Maybe he can help us with some stuff?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shizuya did fix a problem or two in their production. While Nyugen and Shizuya walked out together, Shizuya murmured to him &ldquo;On some sunny day again Nyugen, we&rsquo;ll meet again. See you on the flip side.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;See you later, Shizuya. Good luck on your endeavors.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shizuya walked back home after that, just like usual.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c2" id="h.b86vitw12kdp"><span class="c3">Chapter 6: Sublime, Thy Mortem.</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c8">S</span><span class="c1">hizuya Wo normally went out for his groceries every week to get the regular, Food, Drinks, and everything he needed to survive.

His heartbeat was off, and doctors were shouting in the background.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to die in a few minutes if we don&#39;t do anything, but even then Mortem Chances are </span><span class="c5">real</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;high.&rdquo; Shizuya then realized what was happening. His time ran out, and his fulfilling life as Shizuya Wo and Daisuke Kobayashi had run out.
